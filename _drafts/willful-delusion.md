Creating a new product is hard, creating a new company is even harder.  There are countless reasons why any given company doesnâ€™t exist.  In order to start a company and further to succeed, an entrepreneur needs a calculated sense of willful delusion.  This time is different, this market is different, this team is different.  While a founder needs to be a rational, convincing and brilliant operator, at the same time, she must ignore the mountain of evidence that this company shouldn't exist.
