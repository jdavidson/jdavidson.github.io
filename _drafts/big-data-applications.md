In the same way the open source [LAMP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)) stack of Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP, the big data stack has been established and will be the foundation of a next generation of applications.  Technology, previously only possible at Google, has been made accessible through the generation of this open source.  This stack has accelerated the pace of innovation.

Stack
-------------

This ecosystem is powered by service companies across the broader stack:
<ul>
  <li>AWS - cloud compute and storage</li>
  <li>Hadoop, HDFS, HBase, MongoDB, Cassandra, Riak, Splunk, Amazon Redshift ... - data stores</li>
  <li>Scribe, Flume, Sqoop, Kafka - data ingestion</li>
  <li>Map Reduce, Hive, Pig, Cascading - batch data processing</li>
  <li>Spark / Shark, Impala, Drill, Presto, Tez / Stringer, Druid, Storm, S4 - real time data processing</li>
  <li>Lucene, SOLR - search</li>
  <li>Apache Mahout, Oryx / Myrrix, Kiji - modeling</li>
</ul>

With companies like Cloudera, Hortonworks and MapR<sup>1</sup>, pushing this big data stack innovation.

Application
-------------

**Manual**
With the web click streams, mobile events, the IoT sensors and more, data continues to grow [exponentially](http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/04/schmidt-data/).  The first order of business is to make it accessible and useful.  Actionable analytics is a first step, allowing for manual optimizations.

Analytics - databases and exploration
Business Intelligence - dashboards, and visualization

As evidenced by Tableau, Datameer<sup>1</sup>, Looker<sup>1</sup>.

**Algorithmic**
The manual modeling and offline optimization gives way to algorithmic.

Relevance - ranking given a direct user intent (query)
Recommendation - given indirect user intent
Personalization - customization on a per user level
Anomaly Detection - fraud, threat
Forecast - model generation

Companies like Rich Relevance, WibiData, Sift Sciences, and Optimizely are providing these services.

The result of which is the proliferation of tools and technology that is enabling big data applications previously only possible at places like Google.  These data scientists are creating the next generation of applications only now possible.
