I was recently reminded of the [known](http://www.glassdoor.com/Interview/What-happens-when-you-type-www-google-com-in-your-browser-QTN_56396.htm) Google interview question "What happens when you type www.google.com in your browser?" reading Jean-Baptiste Quero's Google Plus post [Dizzying but invisible depth](https://plus.google.com/112218872649456413744/posts/dfydM2Cnepe) (which would have to be one of the best answers).  He outlines the dizzying complexity that modern technology represents.

<quote>Today's computers are so complex that they can only be designed and manufactured with slightly less complex computers. In turn the computers used for the design and manufacture are so complex that they themselves can only be designed and manufactured with slightly less complex computers. You'd have to go through many such loops to get back to a level that could possibly be re-built from scratch.</quote>

All technology is cumulative.
