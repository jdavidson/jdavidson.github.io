tl;dr Raise enough to hit the next milestones to raise the next round plus a healthy buffer.

After starting PrimaTable in 2011, raising a seed round and selling the company to Hotel Tonight and now sitting on the other side of the table, entrepreneurs commonly ask for guidance on how much to venture funding to raise.

Here are two schools of thought that aren’t necessarily divergent.

1. [Tom Tunguz](http://tomtunguz.com/most-important-principle-of-fund-raising/) "Raise enough money to achieve a set of milestones that will attract a subsequent round of investment from new investors.”

This means raise enough to hit the next milestones and mitigate risk with a sufficient buffer to weather the inevitable bumps.  Valuation for startups only increase on mitigation of risk.  For example, in some seed stage companies, this can mean mitigating technical risk and building a working product.  For a series A, this might mean finding product market fit and showing user engagement.  For later stages, this can be demonstrating a scalable distribution channel and business model.  Regardless of the stage, future rounds will necessitate mitigation of risk.

2. [Mark Andreessen](http://venturehacks.com/articles/how-much-money)[^1] “Raise as much as you can without giving away control of your company, and without being insane. ... In a normal scenario, raising more money rather than less usually makes sense, since you are buying yourself insurance against both internal and external potential bad events."

Mark argues to mitigate financing market risk by raising at the max of the range that is possible.  This make sense to protect against macro changes that change fund raising dynamics as well as gives as much fuel to hold on as long as possible.  This can be detrimental because this ups the level of risk that must be mitigated prior to a subsequent round.

In practice, for most early stage startups, the increments of funding look to be 12 - 18 months of runway.  The round size varies with the team but you can use a [rule of thumb](https://angel.co/salaries) of $125K / developer / year ($100K salary + 25% expenses).

Combining the two strategies, raise enough to hit the next milestones plus a healthy buffer.

1. Figure out the risks and milestones
2. Figure out the process to test and validate your hypotheses
3. Model cash necessary to implement those tests
4. +6 months to grow on
