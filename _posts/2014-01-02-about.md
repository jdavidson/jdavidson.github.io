I’m a senior associate at the venture capital firm Redpoint. I apply a product and engineering background to early stage tech investment with a bias toward marketplaces (after working on a variety at different stages).  I’m always up for a coffee or call and you can reach me [here](mailto:{{ site.owner.email }}?subject=hi).

Quick background for my [story](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jamescdavidson) - I grew up in Silicon Valley and started in tech early with an internship at Google in high school. I then spent four years on the east coast at [Princeton](http://www.princeton.edu/) where I studied Operations Research and Financial Engineering with minors in Computer Science, Finance and Engineering & Management Systems. Upon graduation, I joined Google full-time starting in a quantitative engineering role working on the search ad system. I later switched into the Associate Product Management [program](http://www.quora.com/What-is-Googles-APM-program) at Google and worked as a PM on the YouTube Search and Discovery team.

Always intending to start a company, I spent a year on leave from Google in an internship at KPCB. I became close to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_Dark_(software)">lunatic fringe</a> of start up life and left to co-found PrimaTable. After a series of business model experiments, we ultimately sold the company to Hotel Tonight where I was VP Product immediately prior to joining Redpoint.

I’ll be writing about tech industry from my experience as a VC, sharing thoughts from the perspective of a former engineer, data and product guy. Let me know what you want to hear.
